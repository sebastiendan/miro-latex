## Installation
Install the web plugin in your Miro workspace from [here](https://miro.com/oauth/authorize/?response_type=code&client_id=3074457356457947177&redirect_uri=%2Fconfirm-app-install%2F).

## Usage
- Find the LaTeX button in the bottomBar
- Type your formula and click on the Render button
- Copy the generated image and close the dialog
- Paste the image on your board ðŸŽ‰

## To improve
- The generated PNG image will be directly added to the board after it is rendered once Miro's image widget gets writable (see [here](https://developers.miro.com/reference#board-widgets))
